# Ansible Role: Tailscale Install

An ansible role to install tailscale on *Ubuntu*, *Debian* or *MacOS* systems.

If you want to install on other systems or more advanced options, see [this role](https://github.com/artis3n/ansible-role-tailscale) by @artis3n. I based this off the work of @FuzzyMistborn, adding Debian and MacOS support.

## Requirements

- Debian Linux
- Ubuntu Linux
- MacOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) installed
